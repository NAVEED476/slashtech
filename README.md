# Node.js Express with MySQL Boilerplate

This is a boilerplate for a Node.js Express application with MySQL integration.

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites

Make sure you have the following installed on your system:

- Node.js (v14.x or later)
- MySQL (v5.7 or later)

### Installing

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone 
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

   ```bash
   cd node-express-mysql-boilerplate
   ```

3. Install dependencies:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

### Configuration

1. **MySQL Configuration:**

   - Create a MySQL database for the application.
   - Update the MySQL connection settings in `config/db.config.js` with your database credentials.

2. **Environment Variables:**

   - Create a `.env` file in the root directory.
   - Add environment variables for sensitive information like database credentials. For example:

     ```env
     DB_HOST=localhost
     DB_USER=root
     DB_PASSWORD=your_password
     DB_NAME=your_database_name
     ```

### Running the Application

```bash
npm start
```

The server will start on port 3000 by default. You can access it at [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).
